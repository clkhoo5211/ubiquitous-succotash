## 4. Critical Path Analysis

### 4.1 Critical Path (Cannot be parallelized)

The critical path determines the minimum project duration. Any delay in these tasks directly delays the project.

```
Auth (FR-001, FR-002) → Profiles (FR-003) → Posts (FR-004) → Comments (FR-005) →
Likes (FR-006) → Points (FR-010, FR-011) → Crypto Payments (FR-013) →
User Levels (FR-015) → Permissions (FR-016) → Moderation (FR-017-019) →
MVP Launch → Phase 2 Features → Full Launch
```

**Critical Path Duration**: 26 weeks (6.5 months) with perfect execution

**Actual Duration with Buffer**: 26 weeks (6.5 months) for MVP, 52 weeks (12 months) for full launch

### 4.2 Parallelizable Tasks

These tasks can be developed concurrently by a second developer or during spare time:

- **Month 2**: Image upload (FR-007) + Video embedding (FR-008) while forum features are in QA
- **Month 3**: Search (FR-009) while crypto payment is in development
- **Month 5**: Moderator UI while voting system is in development

## 8. Contingency Plans

### 8.1 Common Risks & Mitigation

#### Risk 1: Blockchain Integration Delays (Probability: 40%, Impact: High)
**Symptoms**: Crypto payment development taking >6 weeks, web3.py issues, testnet failures

**Mitigation**:
- **Pre-emptive**: Research PancakeSwap V2 integration 1 month before Month 3
- **Reactive**: Hire blockchain consultant for 2-week sprint ($5,000 budget)
- **Fallback**: Launch MVP without crypto payments, use PayPal temporarily (revert to crypto in Month 7)

**Timeline Impact**: +2 weeks (Month 3 → 6 weeks instead of 4 weeks)

---

#### Risk 2: Low User Acquisition (Probability: 60%, Impact: High)
**Symptoms**: <500 registered users by Month 6, <10% weekly growth

**Mitigation**:
- **Pre-emptive**: Start marketing 1 month before launch (Month 5)
  - Build Discord/Telegram community early
  - Engage with crypto influencers for feedback
  - Create beta tester program with exclusive perks
- **Reactive**: Increase marketing budget to $2,000/month (ads, influencer partnerships)
- **Pivot**: Focus on niche community (e.g., BNB Chain developers only) instead of broad crypto audience

**Revenue Impact**: $1,000 MRR target at risk → adjust to $500 MRR if <500 MAU

---

#### Risk 3: Security Vulnerability Discovered (Probability: 30%, Impact: Critical)
**Symptoms**: SQL injection, XSS, private key leak, user data breach

**Mitigation**:
- **Pre-emptive**:
  - Security audit in Month 4 (external penetration testing)
  - Code review with security checklist (OWASP Top 10)
  - Bug bounty program ($500-$5,000 rewards)
- **Reactive**:
  - Immediate hotfix deployment (<2 hours)
  - User notification within 72 hours (GDPR requirement)
  - Post-mortem and security hardening
- **Recovery**:
  - Database rollback to last clean backup
  - Password reset for all users if auth compromised
  - Free point recharge compensation for affected users

**Timeline Impact**: -1 week (pull developers from Phase 2 features)

---

#### Risk 4: Scalability Issues (Probability: 50%, Impact: Medium)
**Symptoms**: Slow response times (>2s), database overload, Redis out of memory

**Mitigation**:
- **Pre-emptive**:
  - Load testing in Month 4 and Month 6 (Locust: 1,000 and 10,000 users)
  - Database query optimization (indexes, EXPLAIN analysis)
  - Horizontal scaling setup (auto-scaling to 5 instances)
- **Reactive**:
  - Upgrade database tier (Supabase/Neon: $25/month → $100/month)
  - Upgrade Redis tier (Upstash: free → $10/month)
  - Add CDN for static assets (Cloudflare paid tier)
- **Cost Impact**: +$100/month infrastructure costs

---

#### Risk 5: Regulatory Compliance Violation (Probability: 20%, Impact: Critical)
**Symptoms**: GDPR complaint, AML/KYC violation, platform banned in EU/US

**Mitigation**:
- **Pre-emptive**:
  - Legal review in Month 6 before launch ($2,000 budget)
  - GDPR compliance checklist (data export, deletion, privacy policy)
  - AML monitoring for large transactions (>$1,000 USDT)
- **Reactive**:
  - Immediate compliance fix (<7 days)
  - Legal consultation ($5,000 emergency budget)
  - User communication and transparency
- **Worst-Case**:
  - Shut down platform temporarily until compliant
  - Refund all user balances (use reserve fund)

**Timeline Impact**: +1 month (delay full launch to Month 13)

---

#### Risk 6: Key Developer Leaves (Probability: 30%, Impact: High)
**Symptoms**: Lead developer quits, knowledge loss, project stalls

**Mitigation**:
- **Pre-emptive**:
  - Comprehensive documentation (README, ADR, API docs)
  - Knowledge sharing sessions (weekly demos)
  - Code review requirement (all PRs reviewed)
  - Backup developer on retainer (10 hours/week)
- **Reactive**:
  - Hire replacement developer immediately (2-week hiring process)
  - Onboarding with existing documentation (1-2 weeks)
  - Extend timeline by 1 month
- **Timeline Impact**: +4 weeks (hiring + onboarding)

---

### 8.2 Buffer Allocation

**Total Timeline**: 52 weeks (12 months)
**Productive Time**: 44 weeks
**Buffer Time**: 8 weeks (15% buffer)

**Buffer Distribution**:
- Month 3 (Crypto integration): +2 weeks buffer
- Month 5 (Moderation system): +2 weeks buffer
- Month 6 (Launch prep): +2 weeks buffer
- Month 12 (Full launch): +2 weeks buffer

**Usage Protocol**:
- Use buffer only for unforeseen delays (not scope creep)
- If buffer exhausted, reduce scope (defer features to Phase 2)
- If buffer unused, use for polish and testing (not new features)
