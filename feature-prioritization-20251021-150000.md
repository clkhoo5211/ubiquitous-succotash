**Phase 2 Feature Count**: **15 should-have features**
**Future Features**: **12 could-have features**

**Prioritization Principles**:

## 1. Prioritization Framework

### 1.1 RICE Scoring Method

**RICE Formula**: `RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

**Reach** (0-10): How many users will use this feature per month?
- 10 = 100% of users (everyone)
- 5 = 50% of users
- 1 = 10% of users

**Impact** (0-3): How much will this feature improve the user experience or business metrics?
- 3 = Massive impact (10x better)
- 2 = High impact (3x better)
- 1 = Medium impact (1.5x better)
- 0.5 = Low impact (marginal improvement)

**Confidence** (0-100%): How confident are we in our Reach/Impact estimates?
- 100% = Data-backed (proven by competitors)
- 80% = High confidence (similar features work)
- 50% = Medium confidence (hypothesis)
- 20% = Low confidence (experimental)

**Effort** (Person-Weeks): How long will this take to build?
- 1 = 1 week
- 2 = 2 weeks
- 4 = 1 month
- 8 = 2 months
- 12 = 3 months

**Interpretation**:
- RICE > 50 = **Critical Priority** (drop everything, build this)
- RICE 20-50 = **High Priority** (MVP must-have)
- RICE 10-20 = **Medium Priority** (Phase 2 should-have)
- RICE 5-10 = **Low Priority** (Future could-have)
- RICE < 5 = **Won't Build** (not worth it)

### 1.2 MoSCoW Categorization

**Must-Have (M)**: Critical for MVP launch, no product without these
**Should-Have (S)**: Important but not critical, defer to Phase 2 if needed
**Could-Have (C)**: Nice-to-have, build if time/resources permit
**Won't-Have (W)**: Out of scope, revisit in Year 2+

## 6. Prioritization Decisions & Trade-offs

### 6.1 Why These Features Were Deferred

**Wiki (Phase 2, not MVP)**:
- **Reason**: Complex feature (6 weeks), uncertain adoption (60% confidence)
- **Trade-off**: Focus on core forum first, add wiki after PMF proven
- **Risk**: Competitors could add wiki first (acceptable, we differentiate elsewhere)

**Voice Sessions (Phase 2, not MVP)**:
- **Reason**: Very complex (8 weeks), low confidence (40%), niche appeal (5% host)
- **Trade-off**: Build forum first, add voice for influencers later
- **Risk**: Influencers might not join without voice (low risk, they join for monetization)

**Mobile App (Year 2+, not MVP)**:
- **Reason**: Huge effort (24 weeks), PWA sufficient for MVP
- **Trade-off**: Responsive design + PWA → native app later
- **Risk**: Users prefer native apps (mitigated by excellent responsive design)

---

### 6.2 Why These Features Were Prioritized

**Crypto Payments (MVP, despite 70% confidence)**:
- **Reason**: No revenue = no business (must-have)
- **Risk**: Web3 integration complexity, but BNB Chain proven
- **Mitigation**: Allocate 8 weeks, extensive testing, fallback to manual transfers

**GDPR (MVP, despite low user demand)**:
- **Reason**: Legal requirement, EU users = significant market
- **Risk**: None (well-understood pattern)
- **Trade-off**: 2 weeks well-spent for compliance + trust

**Referrals (Phase 2, not MVP)**:
- **Reason**: Viral growth important, but registration bonus suffices for MVP
- **Trade-off**: Focus on product first, add viral mechanics after PMF
- **Risk**: Slow growth in early months (acceptable, organic growth via Crypto Twitter)
