## 3. Personal Data We Collect

### 3.1 Information You Provide Directly

- **Bio and website** (optional, public) - profile information

#### OAuth2 Social Login (Optional)
When you connect via Meta, Reddit, X (Twitter), Discord, or Telegram:
- OAuth provider user ID
- OAuth access and refresh tokens (encrypted)
- OAuth username and email (from provider)
- OAuth avatar URL (from provider)

**Note**: We do not receive your social media password. Authentication is handled securely by the provider.

#### Profile Information
- **Avatar image** (optional) - stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

- Off-chain database storage (email, password, profile)
- Decision to link accounts to blockchain wallets

We are **joint controllers** with blockchain network participants for:
